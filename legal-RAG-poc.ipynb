Severity Level 1 problems may include catastrophic failure of the system; major data loss or data corruption; or critical functionality is not available, impacting a majority of the Client‚Äôs Authorized Users. If the condition is cause by Client, it is not considered a Severity Level 1 issue. Severity Level 1 problems must be reported via telephone.\\nA ‚ÄúSeverity Level 2‚Äù exists when Client‚Äôs production use of the application is functioning with limited capabilities or is unstable with periodic interruptions. The software may be operating but is severely restricted with no acceptable workaround. If the condition is cause by Client, it is not considered a Severity Level 2 issue.\\nA ‚ÄúSeverity Level 3‚Äù exists when product features are unavailable, but a workaround exists, and the majority of software functions are still useable. Severity Level 3 problems may include error message with workaround; minimal performance degradation impacting a small subset of users at a time, typically less than five; incorrect product behavior with minor impact to less than five people; or questions on product functionality or configuration during implementation. If the condition is cause by Client, it is not considered a Severity Level 3 issue.\\nA ‚ÄúSeverity Level 4‚Äù exists when Client experiences a minor problem or has a question that does not affect the software function, such as ‚Äúhow to‚Äù questions, documentation, general questions, or enhancement requests, and there is no impact to product usage or Client‚Äôs operations. Severity Level 4 problems may include general requests for advice on product usage, clarification on product documentation or release notes, or product enhancement requests.
